# 🌸 Multi-Class Classification on the Iris Dataset

This project showcases a basic **multi-class classification** pipeline using the classic **Iris dataset** provided by scikit-learn. It demonstrates how **Logistic Regression** can be used to classify data points into multiple classes and how to evaluate the model performance using visual tools.

## 📁 Project Description

The Iris dataset is a beginner-friendly and widely used dataset in the machine learning community. It includes 150 samples across three species of Iris flowers: *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*, with four numerical features per sample.

This project focuses on building a complete machine learning pipeline that includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Visualizing feature relationships
- Training a logistic regression model
- Evaluating the model using a confusion matrix and metrics
- Visualizing the classification results

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Scikit-learn** – model building and evaluation
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data handling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualization

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts Covered

1. Understanding the **relationship between features and target labels**
2. Building a **multi-class Logistic Regression model** using One-vs-Rest strategy
3. Performing **train-test split** for robust evaluation
4. Using a **confusion matrix** to interpret results
5. Visualizing class distributions and decision boundaries (if applicable)
